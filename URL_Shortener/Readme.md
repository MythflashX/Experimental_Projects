Unexpected Turn of Events
Experimental Project #3: Emulating How URL Shorteners Work

A few weeks ago, I was scheduled for an interview for a PHP web dev training position. I wanted to pick up PHP beforehand, so I learned the fundamentals while also reviewing Python on the side for a few days. Unfortunately, the interview didn’t happen, and I didn’t want to feel like I wasted a week, so I bounced some ideas with ChatGPT to find something I could build with my newfound PHP knowledge. I got fascinated by LinkedIn's URL shortener, so I decided to emulate something similar.

I needed to learn about Database CRUD operations, and I chose MariaDB. After a few  more days of learning, I dove in. With a bit of Google magic, PHP, MariaDB and tinkering, I managed to complete the project—barely. The code is a mess, but that’s okay; I never intended for it to be perfect. I just wanted to emulate the inner workings of LinkedIn's URLs, and I achieved that.

The project itself took about 5 hours to complete, and the only real challenge was summoning the energy and motivation to push through while fasting. I was low on energy most of the time, so I’m just grateful I got it working.

While it’s a small project, it’s a perfect stepping stone for my upcoming big boi project BakaC. I’ve been learning the mandatory knowledge to work on that for months, and now that I’ve finished this project, I think I have enough of a knowledge base to start working on a prototype.

Overall, it was fun, and not too shabby for an experimental project after just a few days of learning new techs! I seriously gotta get back to Java Spring instead of getting lost with side quests.
